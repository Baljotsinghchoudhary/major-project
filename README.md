# Major-project    Hate Tweet Detection
Online bullying and hate-speech has been on a rise with the increasing technological advancements, as more and more people join social media and engage with each other. Online toxicity is undoubtedly one of the major issues in today's world.

Our goal is to classify tweets into two categories, hate speech or non-hate speech.

### Data Source : Davidson Dataset

This is the original dataset that we have started working with due to its availability with the actual text of the hate tweets. 
The Davidson Dataset contains 24,802 tweets with 5.77% labeled as hate, 77.43% as offensive, and 16.80% as Neutral using crowdsourcing for annotating the tweets into the 3 classes.

## Future Scope
We want to build a software that would automatically detect hate-tweet and limit/block it. 
It shoudld be able to help people filter out the content they donâ€™t want to see and into the Lockout Folder. It can be reviewed later.
